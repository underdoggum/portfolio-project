            Hello! I'm Nathan. I am an aspiring Full-Stack Web Developer with an array of modern technical skills, including:
            <br /><br />
            <ul>
              <li>HTML</li>
              <li>CSS (Bootstrap 5/Bulma)</li>
              <li>JavaScript (ES6)</li>
              <li>React</li>
              <li>NextJS</li>
              <li>RESTful APIs</li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            I'm a Software Engineer and former Mechanical Engineer, with a focus on being a detail-oriented team player. Throughout the years, I've demonstrated a proven track record of developing effective results with continuous improvement and innovation. This, coupled with experience in trending web technologies has ignited my passion for web development. There is *always* more to create, more to teach, more to learn, and that sensational doctrine lies at the heart of this field. <br /><br />
            Overall, my goal is to blend a transparent, methodical approach to full-stack web development with a splash of creativity and a lifelong passion for learning.
